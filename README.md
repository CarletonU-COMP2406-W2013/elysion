Our project is going to be an online order website. We can use it to buy things from the internet, just like we can order the pizza pizza online. For the duties, client will need to know what they want to buy, and then the server side will receive the request then replay them. And the backend can manage the complete website. Like changing text, images, adding products, prices and more functionality.

In the following week, our group will do architecture diagram & external library/program use. In architecture diagram & external library/program use, we will plan about the project and what kind of information will be included in our project. Then, we will do framework demo. In framework demo, we will make the structure of our online order website. Next, we may use two weeks for working prototype/demo. In these two weeks, we will need more details about our online order website such as adding some pictures and so on. We want to let our online order website become more colorful and in order to interest more customers. Afterthat, we will correct our draft documentation which is written every week. In draft documentation, we will make introduce about our project and to we will find where we can improve for our project. We may also go to ask TA when we meet some problems. Thus, we may also spend about 1 weeks. Finally, we will cost 1 weeks about final code and documentation. We will let our online order web site become more beautiful and interesting. In addition, we may also check grammar about the documentation.

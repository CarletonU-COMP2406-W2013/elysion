Our project is going to be an online order website. We can use it to buy things from the internet, just like we can 
order the pizza pizza online. For the duties, client will need to know what they want to buy, and then the server side
will receive the request then replay them. And the backend can manage the complete website. Like changing text, images,
adding products, prices and more functionality.
